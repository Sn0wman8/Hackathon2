## Game Description:
Welcome to RPG, a thrilling adventure where you will test your mettle as a hero in an epic quest to conquer a treacherous tower filled with monsters and claim victory at its peak.

At the start of the game, you will create your own character. Once your character is created with a base stat of 100 HP and 10 ATK, it's time to determine the bonus stats that will further enhance your abilities. The bonus stats are randomly generated through a rolling system, adding an element of chance and unpredictability to your character's progression.

As you ascend the tower, you will encounter a variety of fearsome monsters, each more challenging than the last. Engage in strategic battles, utilizing your wit, skills, and a bit of luck to defeat these adversaries. But fear not, for with each victory, you gain valuable bonus stats and unlock a treasure chest found on the respective floor.

Inside the treasure chests, you will discover powerful weapons that can augment your combat abilities. Each weapon carries a unique bonus ATK stat, allowing you to customize your playstyle and further enhance your chances of success. However, be cautious, as the tower's challenges become increasingly formidable as you near the top.

To aid you on your quest, the game features a saving and loading system, allowing you to store your progress and resume your adventure at any time. Whether you choose to continue your ascent, switch weapons, or take a break, the game offers convenient options to suit your needs.

At the pinnacle of the tower, an ultimate challenge awaits youâ€”the final boss. This formidable enemy tests your skills, pushing you to the brink of your abilities. Employ all the tactics you have learned, exploit your weapon's bonus ATK, and summon the courage to overcome the final obstacle.

Defeat the final boss, and bask in the glory of victory! You will be hailed as a true legend, having conquered the Tower of Legends and secured your place in history.

Get ready to embark on an unforgettable adventure, where every step brings you closer to triumph. Gather your courage, sharpen your blades, and face the Tower of Legends head-on. The fate of the kingdom and your own legacy await your heroic ascent!


## Game Features



## How-to-play


## Object Oriented Concept
Our game has implemented Object Oriented Design. It includes several classes and files for different functionalities. 

**Encapsulation**
  - The code uses classes to encapsulate related data and behavior.
  - For example, the Player class encapsulates attributes like health points (hp), attack points (atk), and the player's name.
  - Similarly all classes encapsulate informations
  - This promotes code organization, modularity, and data hiding, making the code more manageable and maintainable.

**Compositions**
  - The code uses composition to combine objects and create more complex entities.
  - For example, the Player class has an instance of the Inventory class as a member variable.
  - The Inventory class manages the player's items and weapons.
  - By including an instance of the Inventory class as a member variable within the Player class, composition is achieved.
  - The Player class "has" an inventory, meaning it has a relationship with the Inventory class and can access its methods and       attributes.
  - By combining objects through composition, you can reuse existing classes and their functionalities
  - This promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.



## ADTs usage
In our game, we implemented linked list ADT to store several important informations that act as a core role in our game.
